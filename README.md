The text emphasizes real-world applications, the development of critical-thinking skills, diagrams renowned for their pedagogy and clarity, and path-breaking technology. As a hallmark, features in the chapter openings and endings encourage students to think critically about a news article relating to the issue, demonstrating how thinking like an economist can bring a clearer perspective and deeper understanding of today’s events.
